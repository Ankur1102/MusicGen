# Dataset
The dataset we will utilize for this project will contain multiple MIDI files with numerous piano notes that our model can use for training. The MAESTRO dataset contains piano MIDI files that the viewers can download from the following [link.](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/maestro?ref=blog.paperspace.com#v200). I would recommend downloading the maestro-v3.0.0-midi.zip file. The dataset is only 56 MB in the compressed format and about 81 MB when extracted. We can use the data, which contains over 1200 files, to train and develop our deep learning model to generate music.
I have downloaded the data and stored it in "maestro-v3.0.0-midi" folder.
